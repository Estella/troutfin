Troutfin was taken on by a single coder with an ambitious dream.

       -----//-----      Bahamut-team     -----//-----

Bahamut was taken on by a group of loosely knit coders that decided that
Dreamforge just was eating up too much CPU to handle DALnet's growing user
base.  Originally starting out as the DFhybrid project, it slowly grew
into the Bahamut project as the peices started falling together.

Bahamut is based upon the hybrid IRCd, developed for EFnet, and we most
surely wouldn't be where we are today without the dedication of the coders
that developed that IRCd.  The Hybrid team is outlined in the file
included with this distribution, in doc/Hybrid-team.  Please look over
that file, those people are as much to credit for this as the people
listed here.

People who have supported the Bahamut project with code, support, or
testing are, in alphabetical order:

Aaron Wiebe         epiphani@dal.net
Chip Norkus         wd@dal.net
David Friedman      driz@dal.net
David Knepper       dakal@dal.net

Thanks goes out to all those not listed here, your help is much
appreciated.

Feel free to contact the Bahamut team with any bugs, bug fixes, and the
like at: coders@dal.net

Also, there is a public mailing list for bahamut: dalnet-src@dal.net.
This list would be the place to send suggestions and comments regarding
Bahamut.

And, last but not least, the Bahamut website is at http://bahamut.dal.net.

Thanks for the Support,
The Bahamut Coding Team


       -----//-----     Hybrid-team     -----//-----

The hybrid team is a group of ircd coders who were frustrated
with the instability and all-out "dirtiness" of the efnet ircd's
available. "hybrid" is the name for the collective efforts of a group
of people, all of us.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this effort..

We have run the code through "purify", a commercial program designed
to find memory leaks. The code has been mostly prototyped. Profiling has also
been done to catch slow portions of the code. Portions of "crufty" code have
been re-written. We have also looked at making the code as easy to setup
up and run as possible using configure, checking header files etc.
Finally speed enhancements and other enhancements have been made to this ircd.

That is not to say that there are still not bugs, There are always bugs.
But we have reviewed each others work on this project, and are open
to bug reports.

The following people have contributed blood, sweat, and/or code to
this release of hybrid, in nick alphabetical order.

cbongo, Chris A. Bongaarts (cab@tc.umn.edu)
comstud, Chris Behrens (cbehrens@concentric.net)
Dianora, Diane Bruce (db@db.net)
johan, Johannes Erdfelt (jerdfelt@eng.mindspring.net)
orabidoo, Roger Espel LLima (espel@unix.bigots.org)
Rodder, Jon Lusky (lusky@vol.com)
Shadowfax, Michael Pearce (mpearce@varner.com)
ThemBones, Brian Kraemer (kraemer@u.washington.edu)
Wohali, Joan Touzet (joant@cadence.com)

Others are welcome.

Jan 1991 - IRC 2.6  jto@tolsun.oulu.fi
        - Multiple Channels and protocol changes

Contributions were made by a cast of dozens, including the following:

Markku Jarvinen <mta@tut.fi>: Emacs-like editing facility for the client

Jeff Trim <jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu>: enhancements and advice

Vijay Subramaniam <vijay@lll-winken.llnl.gov>: advice and ruthless publicity

Karl Kleinpaste <karl@cis.ohio-state.edu>: user's manual

Greg Lindahl <gl8f@virginia.edu>: AUTOMATON code, the Wumpus GM automaton,
myriad bug fixes

Bill Wisner <wisner@hayes.fai.alaska.edu>: numerous bug fixes and code
enhancements

Tom Davis <conslt16@zeus.unl.edu> and Tim Russell <russell@zeus.unl.edu>:
VMS modifications

Markku Savela <msa@tel4.tel.vtt.fi>: advice, support, and being the
incentive to do some of our *own* coding. :)

Tom Hopkins <hoppie@buengf.bu.edu>: bug fixes, quarantine lines,
consolidation of various patches.

Christopher Davis <ckd@cs.bu.edu>: EFnet/Anet gateway coding,
many automata ;), documentation fixing.

Helen Rose <hrose@cs.bu.edu>: documentation updating, and fixing.

Tom Hinds <rocker@bucsf.bu.edu>: emacs client updating.

Tim Miller <cerebus@bu-pub.bu.edu>: various server and client-breaking
features.

Darren Reed <avalon@coombs.anu.edu.au>: various bug fixes and enhancements.
Introduced nickname and channelname hash tables into the server.

The version 2.2 release was coordinated by Mike Bolotski

The version 2.4 release was coordinated by Markku Savela and
Chelsea Ashley Dyerman

The version 2.5.2 release was coordinated by Christopher Davis, Helen Rose,
and Tom Hopkins.

The versions 2.6.2, 2.7 and 2.8 releases were coordinated by Darren Reed.

Contributions for the 2.8 release from the following people:
Matthew Green <phone@coombs.anu.edu.au>
Chuck Kane <ckane@ece.uiuc.edu>
Matt Lyle <matt@oc.com>
Vesa Ruokonen <ruokonen@lut.fi>

Markku Savela <Markku.Savela@vtt.fi> / April 1990
Fixed various bugs in 2.2PL1 release server (2.2msa.4) and changed
sockets to use non-blocking mode (2.2msa.9). [I have absolutely
nothing to do with clients :-]

Chelsea Ashley Dyerman <chelsea@earth.cchem.berkeley.edu> / April 1990
Rewrote the Makefiles, restructuring of source tree. Added libIrcd.a to
the Makefile macros, numerous reformatting of server text messages, and
added mkversion.sh to keep track of compilation statistics. Numerous
bug fixes and enhancements, and co-coordinator of the 2.4 release.

jarlek@ifi.uio.no added mail functions to irc.

Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> / May, June 1990:
* Patched KILL-line feature for ircd.conf, works now.
  Enhancement:  Time intervals can be specified in passwd-field.
  Result: KILL-Line is only active during these intervals
* Patched PRIVMSG handling, now OPER can specify masks for sending
  private messages, advantage: msg to all at a specified server or host.
* Little tests on irc 2.5 alpha, fixed some little typos in client code.
  Change: common/debug.c has been moved to ircd/s_debug.c, and a
  irc/c_debug.c has been created, for the benefit that wrong server msg
  are displayed if client does not recognize them. (strange, if a server
  sends an 'unknown command', isn't it?)

Tom Hopkins <hoppie@buengf.bu.edu> / September, October 1990:
* Patched msa's K lines for servers (Q lines).
* Consolidated several patches, including Stealth's logging patch.
* Fixed several minor bugs.
* Has done lots of other stuff that I can't seem to remember, but he
  always works on code, so he has to have done alot more than three
  lines worth. :)

Thanks go to those persons not mentioned here who have added their advice,
opinions, and code to IRC.
